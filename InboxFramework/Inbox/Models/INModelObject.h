 Note that -save is eventually persistent. The save operation may be held in queue
 until network connectivity is available.

/** @name Override Points & Subclassing Support */

/**
 Subclasses override resourceMapping to define the mapping between their
 Objective-C @property's and the key-value pairs in their JSON representations. Providing
 this mapping allows -initWithResourceDictionary: and -resourceDictionary to convert the instance
 into JSON without additional glue code.

 A typical subclass implementation looks like this:

 + (NSMutableDictionary *)resourceMapping
 {
   NSMutableDictionary * mapping = [super resourceMapping];
   [mapping addEntriesFromDictionary: @{
     @"firstName": @"first_name",
     @"lastName": @"last_name",
     @"emailAddress": @"email_address"
   }];
   return mapping;
 }

 @return A dictionary mapping iOS property names to JSON fields.

@return The URL path to this object.
*/

/**
 @return The table that should be used to cache this model in local storage.
 */

/**
 @return An array of property names other than ID and namespaceID that should be
 queryable. It's important to return all of the properties you may want to use in
 predicates and sort descriptors.
 */

 Setup should be overridden in subclasses to perform additional initialization
 that needs to take place after -initWithCoder: or -initWithResourceDictionary: The base class
 implementation does nothing.
